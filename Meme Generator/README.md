👉 You will need to provide your own API endpoint.

Find a meme API you like (e.g. https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes or any other meme image source).

Open the fetch request inside WindowTracker.jsx (or wherever your API call is written).

Replace the placeholder with your API URL:

fetch("/_ get from internet your preferred memeGenerator API URL _/")
